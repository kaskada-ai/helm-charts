    description: 'Kaskada is a query engine for event-based (timestamped) data.  This
      helm chart installs a persistant version of the kaskada service in the simplest
      configuration possible. This chart is primarily for initial testing and should
      not be used in production scenarios.  In this setup, the kaskada service runs
      as two containers in a single pod, and persists its database as a file on attached
      storage. It also requires access to an object store. '
